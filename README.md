# ThreadTheNeedle
An Android application

This is a project for the course "Physics in SW development"

The mission is to thread the needle, but your hands are sweaty and you have had too much coffee. 
Will you succeed in your quest?

6.2.2018 Implemented a functioning main menu. Background image features a great hero of our time. Thread class is up and running as intended. Needle class still needs a visual rework since the needle is still in its ball form. Winning conditions are not yet implemented.
